Absolutely — here’s a **clear breakdown of different types of chips (beyond just GPUs)** and **who currently owns the most market share** in those categories.

---

## 🔍 **Main Types of Chips (Beyond GPUs)**

Chips are designed for different computing tasks. Here are the major types:

### 🧠 **1. CPUs — Central Processing Units**

* **General-purpose “brains”** of computers.
* Perform a wide range of tasks sequentially.
* Found in PCs, servers, smartphones.
  💡 In data centers in 2024, **CPUs still held a larger overall processor market share than GPUs** — about 51% vs lower for GPUs in that specific segment. ([Mordor Intelligence][1])

---

### ⚙️ **2. ASICs — Application-Specific Integrated Circuits**

* Custom chips designed for **specialized tasks** (e.g., machine learning inference, crypto mining).
* Highly efficient and power-optimized for their specific job.
* Examples: Google’s **TPUs**, AWS **Inferentia**, company-specific AI silicon. ([iknow.stpi.niar.org.tw][2])

📊 Some analysts estimate that ASICs account for a **significant portion of AI processors**, perhaps ~40% in certain markets where specialized inference chips are used, while GPUs take the rest. ([Investors][3])

---

### 🧩 **3. FPGAs — Field-Programmable Gate Arrays**

* Flexible chips that can be **reconfigured after manufacturing**.
* Useful in telecom, networking, edge AI, and hardware acceleration.
* Not as high performance as GPUs or ASICs, but highly versatile. ([SQ Magazine][4])

---

### 🤖 **4. TPUs — Tensor Processing Units**

* A **type of ASIC** built specifically for tensor math used in machine learning.
* Google’s TPUs are one of the best-known examples.
* Growing in cloud deployment. ([SQ Magazine][4])

---

### 🧠 **5. NPUs / AI Accelerators**

* Neural Processing Units (NPUs) or AI accelerators.
* Purpose-built for AI inference on mobile and edge devices (smartphones, IoT, etc.).
* Found in chips from Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, etc. ([SQ Magazine][4])

---

### 🔋 **6. SoCs (System on a Chip)**

* Integrate CPUs, GPUs, and sometimes NPUs on one chip.
* Common in smartphones and embedded devices.
* Not a separate chip *type* exactly, but a package combining multiple processors. ([generativevalue.com][5])

---

## 📊 **Which Companies / Chips Have the Biggest Market Share?**

### 🏆 **GPUs — Still Dominant in AI Compute**

* **NVIDIA** leads overwhelmingly, especially in data center GPUs used for AI training and inference — with *estimates around ~90% market share* in that segment. ([acquinox.capital][6])
* **AMD** holds a much smaller share in AI GPU sales, and **Intel’s discrete GPU share is still very low**. ([PC Gamer][7])

---

### 🖥️ **CPUs — Still Very Large Overall**

* Traditional CPU market is dominated by **Intel and AMD**.
* In some data center segments, CPUs account for more total share than GPUs, though that is changing rapidly with AI demand. ([Mordor Intelligence][1])
* **Arm-based CPUs** are growing strongly (often used by AWS, Apple, etc.). ([Reuters][8])

---

### 🔌 **ASIC / Inference Chips**

* **Google’s TPUs** are big for cloud AI workloads.
* **AWS** has its own AI ASICs (Inferentia, Trainium) in cloud services. ([SQ Magazine][4])
* In specialized ASIC markets, reports have cited **Broadcom** as leading — with maybe ~55–60% in high-end ASICs — followed by others like **Marvell**. ([Investors][3])

---

### 🔄 **FPGAs & NPUs (Edge / Telecom / Mobile)**

* FPGAs are often used in specialized networking and edge processing.
* Smartphones incorporate NPUs from companies like **Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung**, and these have very large *unit shipments* though lower revenue per chip compared to data center chips. ([SQ Magazine][4])
